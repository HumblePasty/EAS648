### PPRN (Preliminary Pro-Rata Need)

PPRN stands for Preliminary Pro-Rata Need. It's a calculated figure that aims to reflect the portion of funding each CoC might receive under HUD's competitive CoC funding, based on factors like demographic data and the severity of homelessness issues in the community. This number is derived according to formulas and guidelines set by HUD.
