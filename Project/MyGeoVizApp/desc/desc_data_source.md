### Data Source

The data visualized in this application originates from authoritative and reliable sources, ensuring accuracy and relevance in addressing the issue of homelessness in Michigan.

The primary data regarding the [**Continuum of Care (CoC) zones**](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/gis-tools/) and their respective details are sourced from the U.S. Department of **[Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](https://www.hud.gov/)**. This dataset includes critical information such as the name and number of each CoC, along with key financial metrics like the Annual Renewal Demand (ARD), Preliminary Pro-Rata Need (PPRN), and Final Pro-Rata Need (FPRN).

Additionally, the geographical boundaries for Michigan's counties, essential for overlaying CoC data, are derived from trusted governmental geographical information systems. 

Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive view of the homelessness landscape in Michigan, facilitating informed analysis and decision-making.
