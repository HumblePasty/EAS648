### FPRN (Final Pro-Rata Need)

FPRN stands for Final Pro-Rata Need. It represents the final funding needs of each CoC in the HUDâ€™s CoC program allocation process, taking into account various adjustments (like regional homelessness statistics and resource availability). It is a more precise figure than the preliminary assessment, used to determine the final amount of funding each CoC is eligible to apply for.
